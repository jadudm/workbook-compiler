## Testing

Run

```
python -m pytest
```

or

```
pytest
```

from within src/wbc-cli



I need to figure out how to set up an installable package that can have tests that are aware of the project/package paths.


## Testing

Running the command line

```
pipx run hatch env run wb
```

May need `pipx` in the local environment

## Installation

```console
pip install wbc-cli
```
