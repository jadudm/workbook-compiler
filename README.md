# workbook-compiler

This is a library and command line tool for turning workbook specifications in JSonnet into XLSX documents.

## Why?

There are places where spreadsheets are tools that are 1) essential and 2) unavoidable. Those spreadsheets might be templatized, and generally need to be maintained/updated on a regular basis. In that case, you need a tool that makes it easy to specify what a workbook should look like, and a way to easily generate/regerate those workbooks.
